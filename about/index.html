        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Woah, how did you make that thing?</h3>
        It's a bit technical, but here goes...<br><br>
        
        <b>1.</b> I made a sprite for the bot (highly recommended)<br><br>
        <b>2.</b> I copied the "send request to server" and "wait for promise"<br>
        to the bot sprite<br><br>
        <b>3.</b> Every so often, I check the newest post using<br>
        (item 1 of [posts]) and split it into chunks<br><br>
        <b>4.</b> I check the contents of those chunks and work out what<br>
        the bot should send (if anything at all)<br><br>
        <b>5.</b> (Optional) Store extra data, parse the command further, etc.<br><br>
        
        ...now you can stop asking me about it!
